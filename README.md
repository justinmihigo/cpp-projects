Projects for C++ We did while learning
### 1. Tic tac toe:
   This is a famous game where when a player get his three pieces aligned before another wins. We used C++ switches and loops to make this happen.
### 2. Hangman:
   This is a program for guessing a word, you are given trials and hints of the correct letters in place. we used vectors to make words of list which is more dynamic than arrays.
### 3. Bike rental program:
   This is a Program that gets updated time of renting the bike you choose an option to go with you input money you are going to pay, and gives time you have to use, or input time and it generates amount you have to pay. as hours increase payments also changes. We used ctime library to get time and its calculations.
### 4. Complex numbers addition:
   By using operator overloading concepts, we overload a + and a << operator to perform addition between two complex numbers and it output the complex number by using constructors, templates.
